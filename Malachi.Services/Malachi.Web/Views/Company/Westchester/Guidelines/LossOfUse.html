<h4><strong>Loss of Use</strong></h4>
<p>
    Coverage D is for Loss of Use. This coverage is only used if your home is damaged to the extent that you can no longer live in it. For example, 
    if a pipe bursts and floods the home and it causes you to live in a hotel for a couple of months while the home is being repaired; the loss of 
    use coverage will reimburse you for the expenses such as food, lodging, gas, etc.
