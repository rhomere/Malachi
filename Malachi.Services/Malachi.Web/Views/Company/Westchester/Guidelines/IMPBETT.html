<h4><strong>Improvements and Betterments</strong></h4>
<p>Improvements & Betterments is a “Tenant” related Coverage. It provides a tenant the ability to cover the a portion of a build that, in any other circumstance, they have no insurable interest. A building Owner is given no protection in this coverage. In the case of a condo unit owner, the fixtures/improvements/alterations for the interior (“dry wall in”) of the unit should be classified as BPP. If any improvements are put in by the owner it needs to be added and made part of the building coverage to prevent a coinsurance penalty in the event of a claim.</p>
