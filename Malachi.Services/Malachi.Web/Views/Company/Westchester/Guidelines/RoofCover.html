    <p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Built-Up</strong></p>

    <p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Single Ply Membrane</strong></p>
    <p>
        Single-ply membranes are flexible sheets of compounded synthetic materials that are manufactured in a factory. These are commonly known as rubber sheet 
        roofing products, but are more accurately referred to as EPDM, PVC, or modified bitumen sheets. For steel and concrete buildings, this is the most common 
        type of roof covering.

    <p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Normal Shingle</strong></p>
    <p>
        This option refers to shingles that are manufactured by coating a reinforcing material (felt or fibrous glass mat) with asphalt and have mineral granules
        on the side exposed to weather. These shingles, which are often referred to as composition shingles, are typically manufactured in strips and are one of the
        most common roofing materials used in the U.S.

    <p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Shingle Rated for High Wind Speeds</strong></p>
    <p>
        This option refers to composition shingles that meet ASTM D-3161 Class F or ASTM D-7168 Class H standards. These are wind-resistance standards that test the 
        ability of shingles to remain attached to a roof at a higher wind speed than standard composition shingles. Products that meet the 1994 South Florida Building 
        Code or the 2001 Florida Building Code have passed these tests.

        Although available for use in all North Atlantic Hurricane Models regions, these roofs are most prevalent in the Caribbean, notably in Puerto Rico 
        and Jamaica.
