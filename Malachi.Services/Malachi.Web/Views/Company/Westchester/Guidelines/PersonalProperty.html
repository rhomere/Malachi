<h4><strong>Personal Property</strong></h4>
<p>
    Coverage C is coverage for your personal property. This coverage insures all of your belongings. This is an essential coverage 
    when the interior of the home sustains damage, like in a fire. On most policies there is only so much coverage that they provide 
    for valuable items such as paintings, jewelry, guns, etc. It is in your best interest to review your policy to see if more 
    coverage is needed to insure you have the right amount of coverage.
