<h4><strong>Water Backup</strong></h4>
<p>
    Water back-up provides coverage in the event of a back-up of a sewer system, drainage system or sub-pump. A back-up means that there is an accumulation 
    caused by a stoppage in the flow; something that prevents water from continuing down its path, so it is forced to reverse direction and go back the other 
    way. When this happens, it can create pressure in other areas of the pipes and create leaks or bursts, which in turn can damage your structure or personal 
    belongings depending on how severe the back-up is.
