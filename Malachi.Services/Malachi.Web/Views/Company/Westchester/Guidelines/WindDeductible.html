<h4><strong>Wind Deductible</strong></h4>
<p>A separate, higher deductible provision that applies to loss caused by wind or hail. Often, the deductible is expressed as a percentage of the value of the property or, in a homeowners policy, as a percentage of the dwelling limit, rather than as a flat dollar amount. In some Atlantic and Gulf coast states, insurers have filed a variation of this deductible that applies an even higher percentage deductible in the event of loss from a "named storm," such as a hurricane.</p>
