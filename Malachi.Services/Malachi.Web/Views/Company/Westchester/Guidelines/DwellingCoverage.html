<h4><strong>Dwelling Coverage</strong></h4>
<p>
    Coverage A on an insurance policy is the dwelling coverage amount. The dwelling portion of your insurance covers the physical structure of 
    your home; the walls, floors, ceilings, etc. This coverage protects your home from damage to the actual structure and anything that is 
    permanently attached to the structure.
