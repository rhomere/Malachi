<h4><strong>Personal Injury</strong></h4>
<p>
    Personal injury liability coverage extends to five basic categories of acts or conduct. These include:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>False arrest, detention, or imprisonment</li>
    <li>Libel, slander, defamation, or product disparagement</li>
    <li>Malicious prosecution (which may include abuse of process)</li>
    <li>Wrongful eviction, wrongful entry, or violation of right of private occupancy</li>
    <li>Invasion of or violation of right of privacy</li>
</ol>
<p>
    None of these categories of conduct can be an accident. As a result, most homeowners liability coverages refer to the covered events as offenses, 
    rather than attempting to subject them to the policy's occurrence/accident requirement.
